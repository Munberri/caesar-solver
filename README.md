# Caesar Solver
This python program solves caesar encrypted messages. It tries to find the most likely key by checking that the words in the decrypted string using said key are English words.

This program uses [NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)](https://www.nltk.org/)

This program currently only works with alphabetic letters and is not case-sensitive (everything is lowercase).
This program is by no means perfect, and does not work every time.
